# New Pull Request checklist

## Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) please check that you've considered the following steps

- Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request, otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project. [Create an Issue](#submitting_an_issue) to discuss potential big PR.
- Search in GitHub for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission.
- Provide plenty of context and reasoning around your changes, to help us merge quickly.
- Follow our [Coding Rules](CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-rules)
- Follow our [Commit message conventions](CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-guidelines)
- Close related issue in PR header message using [GitHub keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages).
- If your PR gets out of date, we may ask you to rebase as you are more familiar with your changes than we will be.
- If your PR fail on CI tests, we may ask you to fix it.
- [Check documentation about Pull Request on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
