- [Bug Report](#add-a-bug-report)
- [Feature Requests](#add-a-new-feature)

## ‚ùìIf you have a question or need a Support

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep **t3kit GitHub issues** for bug reports and feature requests. [t3kit Slack channel](SUPPORT.md) is a much better place to ask questions and get support.

To save your and our time, **we will regularly close all issues** that are requests for general support and redirect people to t3kit Slack.

## üêûAdd a Bug report

If you find a bug in the code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to particular t3kit repository, or even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request) with a fix.

## üöÄAdd a new Feature

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our t3kit repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- **Small Features** can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue please check that you've considered the following steps:

- Add a single issue per problem
- Check **duplicates** - use the search feature to ensure that the problem hasn't been reported before.
- Check **dependencies** - make sure you're on the right version of dependencies.
- Check [Browsers and devices](#browsers-and-devices)
- Use **Issue templates** - add a new issue by filling out the issue template.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate/fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you **we are going to close an issue** that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) please check that you've considered the following steps:

- ‚ùóÔ∏è**Please ask** first before embarking on any significant pull request, otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project. [Create an Issue](#submitting_an_issue) to discuss potential big PR.
- Search in GitHub for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission.
- Provide plenty of context and reasoning around your changes, to help us merge quickly.
- Follow our [Coding Rules](#coding-rules)
- Follow our [Commit message conventions](#commit-message-guidelines)
- Close related issue in PR header message using [GitHub keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages).
- If your PR gets out of date, we may ask you to rebase as you are more familiar with your changes than we will be.
- If your PR fail on CI tests, we may ask you to fix it.
- [Check documentation about Pull Request on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

## Coding Rules

### Setup IDE / Editor preferences

Set your editor to use [t3kit Editor config](https://github.com/t3kit/t3kit-starter/blob/master/.editorconfig) settings to avoid common code inconsistencies and dirty diffs.

_[Read more about Editor config and download plugins](https://editorconfig.org)_

### PHP, TypoScript, TSconfig, XLIFF, Yaml

We follow [TYPO3 coding guidelines](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/master/en-us/CodingGuidelines/Index.html)

### JS

We follow [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com)

### CSS, SCSS

We follow [Stylelint Config Standard](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard)

### Shell scripts

Use [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) static analysis tool for shell scripts

### Dockerfile

Use [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) as a Dockerfile linter

***

## Commit Message Guidelines

Each commit message consists of a **[label](#labels)** and short **[message](#git-message)**.

Also, it is possible to use special keywords for [closing Github issues](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages).

### Git message

- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" or "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Labels

Please use semantic labels for your messages, but if commit message is not very important, you can skip labels.
Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è**Only commits with labels will be added in CHANGELOG file**, that's why it is important to use predefined labels on your commits.

- **[FEATURE]** - A new feature
- **[BUGFIX]** - A bug fix
- **[TASK]** - Any task, which is not a **new feature** or **bugfix**
- **[TEST]** - Adding/updating tests and CI config
- **[DOC]** - Documentation only changes/updates
- **[WIP]** - Work in progress tag, should not be present when creating pull requests
- **[!!!]** - Breaking Changes

‚ÄºÔ∏è**Important:** Commit label must be **only one**, except if it Breaking Changes, then we will need to add _"Breaking Changes"_ label `[!!!]` at front.

For example (Breaking Changes):

``` git
[!!!][BUGFIX] change default CSS styling for Text and Image CE
```
